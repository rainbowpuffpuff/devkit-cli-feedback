# Bug Report: `devkit avs run` Fails After Modifying `main.go`

## Summary

After successfully modifying the `cmd/main.go` file in the Hourglass AVS template, the `go test` and `devkit avs build` commands complete without issue. However, when executing `devkit avs run`, both the `executor-1` and `aggregator-1` containers fail to start, exiting immediately with code 1. The primary errors appear to be a `connection refused` for the executor and a `key decryption` failure for the aggregator.

## Steps to Reproduce

1.  Start with a previously working devnet environment using the Hourglass AVS template.
2.  Replace the contents of `cmd/main.go` with the code provided below.
3.  Run `go test` to confirm the logic works in isolation.
4.  Run `devkit avs build` to compile the AVS and contracts.
5.  Run `devkit avs run` to start the local devnet.

## Code Changes

The `cmd/main.go` file was modified to the following:

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"time"

	"github.com/Layr-Labs/hourglass-monorepo/ponos/pkg/performer/server"
	performerV1 "github.com/Layr-Labs/protocol-apis/gen/protos/eigenlayer/hourglass/v1/performer"
	"go.uber.org/zap"
)

// This offchain binary is run by Operators running the Hourglass Executor. It contains
// the business logic of the AVS and performs worked based on the tasked sent to it.
// The Hourglass Aggregator ingests tasks from the TaskMailbox and distributes work
// to Executors configured to run the AVS Performer. Performers execute the work and
// return the result to the Executor where the result is signed and return to the
// Aggregator to place in the outbox once the signing threshold is met.

type TaskWorker struct {
	logger *zap.Logger
}

func NewTaskWorker(logger *zap.Logger) *TaskWorker {
	return &TaskWorker{
		logger: logger,
	}
}

func (tw *TaskWorker) ValidateTask(t *performerV1.TaskRequest) error {
	tw.logger.Sugar().Infow("Validating task",
		zap.Any("task", t),
	)

	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Implement your AVS task validation logic here
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// This is where the Perfomer will validate the task request data.
	// E.g. the Perfomer may validate that the request params are well formed and adhere to a schema.

	// For our string length calculation, we'll validate that the data is not empty.
	// The correct field name is Payload.
	if t.Payload == nil || len(t.Payload) == 0 {
		return fmt.Errorf("task payload is empty, cannot calculate length")
	}

	return nil
}

func (tw *TaskWorker) HandleTask(t *performerV1.TaskRequest) (*performerV1.TaskResponse, error) {
	tw.logger.Sugar().Infow("Handling task",
		zap.Any("task", t),
	)

	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// Implement your AVS logic here
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// This is where the Performer will do the work and provide compute.
	// E.g. the Perfomer could call an external API, a local service or a script.

	// The correct field name is Payload.
	// The task data is expected to be a string.
	inputString := string(t.Payload)
	// Calculate the length of the string.
	length := len(inputString)

	tw.logger.Sugar().Infow("Calculated string length",
		"input_string", inputString,
		"calculated_length", length,
	)

	// The result needs to be a byte slice. We'll convert the integer length
	// to its string representation and then to bytes.
	resultBytes := []byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d", length))

	return &performerV1.TaskResponse{
		TaskId: t.TaskId,
		Result: resultBytes,
	}, nil
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	l, _ := zap.NewProduction()

	w := NewTaskWorker(l)

	pp, err := server.NewPonosPerformerWithRpcServer(&server.PonosPerformerConfig{
		Port:    8080,
		Timeout: 5 * time.Second,
	}, w, l)
	if err != nil {
		panic(fmt.Errorf("failed to create performer: %w", err))
	}

	if err := pp.Start(ctx); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```

## Command Outputs

### 1. `go test` Output (Success)

The test command passes, indicating the Go logic is sound.

```bash
q@q-Standard-PC-Q35-ICH9-2009:~/my-avs-project/cmd$ go test
2025-06-15T18:51:11.902+0200	INFO	cmd/main.go:31	Validating task	{"task": "task_id:\"test-task-id\" payload:\"test-data\" metadata:\"test-metadata\""}

PASS
ok  	github.com/Layr-Labs/hourglass-avs-template/cmd	0.005s
```

### 2. `devkit avs build` Output (Success)

The build command completes successfully.

```bash
q@q-Standard-PC-Q35-ICH9-2009:~/my-avs-project$ devkit avs build

```

### 3. `devkit avs run` Output (Failure)

The run command fails, and the containers exit immediately.

```bash

## Error Analysis

Two distinct errors are causing the AVS components to fail:

1.  **Executor Error**: The executor cannot connect to the Ethereum node (anvil/hardhat).
    > `Error: failed to initialize contract caller: failed to get chain ID: Post "http://172.17.0.1:8545": dial tcp 172.17.0.1:8545: connect: connection refused`
    This suggests that the local blockchain container is either not running, not yet ready, or is not accessible on the Docker network when the executor tries to connect.

2.  **Aggregator Error**: The aggregator fails to start due to a private key issue.
    > `Error: failed to get private key: failed to decrypt private key: could not decrypt key with given password`
    This indicates a problem with the keystore file or the password used to decrypt it, which is typically managed by the `devkit` environment setup.
