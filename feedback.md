# DevKit Documentation Feedback

## Higher Priority

1.  **Add a "Quick Start" section for faster onboarding.**

    When a new user lands on the README, their primary goal is to get a basic AVS running as quickly as possible. The current `Step-by-Step Guide` is very detailed but can be overwhelming. A condensed "Quick Start" box at the top would significantly improve the initial developer experience.

    **Suggestion:**

    Add the following section near the top of the README:

    ## ðŸš€ Quick Start

    1.  **Create Project:**
        ```bash
        devkit avs create my-avs-project && cd my-avs-project
        ```
    2.  **Set RPC URL:**
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env 
        # Then edit .env to set your L1_FORK_URL
        ```
    3.  **Build:**
        ```bash
        devkit avs build
        ```
    4.  **Run Devnet:**
        ```bash
        devkit avs devnet start
        ```
    5.  **Test Your AVS:**
        ```bash
        devkit avs call --signature="(string)" args='("hello world")'
        ```
    6. **Add AVS logic:**
        ```modify main.go file to add different functionality
        ```

    >*\*If `devnet start` fails, see the [Common Errors](#common-errors) section below.*

2.  **Clarify the RPC URL requirement.**

    The documentation mentions setting both `L1_FORK_URL` and `L2_FORK_URL` in the `.env` file. However, the current setup only requires the L1 fork URL. This should be clarified to avoid confusion.

## Lower Priority

1.  **Create a `devkit doctor` command.**

    A command to verify all prerequisites (`go`, `docker`, `foundry`, `jq`, etc.) and their versions would be very useful. This would help users diagnose environment issues early and increase their confidence in the setup.

2.  **Add a "Debugging the Devnet" section.**

    This section is critical for when `devkit avs devnet start` fails. It should explain that the command is a `docker-compose` wrapper and teach users the most important Docker commands for debugging the underlying services.

    **Suggested Content:**

    > ### Debugging the Devnet
    >
    > The `devkit avs devnet start` command uses Docker Compose to manage several services (Anvil, Aggregator, Executor). If something goes wrong, you can inspect the containers directly.
    >
    > -   **How to list all containers (running and stopped):**
    >     ```bash
    >     docker ps -a
    >     ```
    >
    > -   **How to view logs for a specific service (e.g., the executor):**
    >     ```bash
    >     docker logs hourglass-local-executor-1 -f
    >     ```
